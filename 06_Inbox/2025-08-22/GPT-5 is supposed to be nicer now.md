OpenAI announced late Friday that it’s updating its latest model to be “warmer and friendlier.”

The company recently [launched the much-anticipated GPT-5](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1956461718097494196) in a process that [CEO Sam Altman admitted](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/) was “a little more bumpy than we’d hoped for,” with some users complaining that they preferred the previous model, GPT-4o.

OpenAI is trying to address some of those complaints with this update, with changes that it says are “subtle” but will make GPT-5 “more approachable now.”

“You’ll notice small, genuine touches like ‘Good question’ or ‘Great start,’ not flattery,” the company wrote in [a social media post](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1956461718097494196). “Internal tests show no rise in sycophancy compared to the previous GPT-5 personality.“

At a dinner this week with journalists, OpenAI executives tried to focus on the company’s plans beyond GPT-5, but as Max Zeff reports, [the rocky launch was the elephant in the room](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/sam-altman-over-bread-rolls-explores-life-after-gpt-5/). As far as model friendliness goes, VP Nick Turley said that GPT-5 was “just very to the point,” but that the new update would — as now announced — make it feel warmer.
