▼ Summary

– [Databricks](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/databricks/ "All about Databricks (Organization)") is raising a $1 billion round at a $100 billion valuation, co-led by Thrive and [Insight Partners](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/insight-partners/ "Insight Partners").  
– The [company](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/company/ "company") did not need operational cash but raised funds specifically for two projects: a database for [AI](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/ai/ "All about AI (Technology)") agents and an AI agent platform.  
– Its new database product, Lakebase, is enterprise-grade and based on Postgres, targeting a [market](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/market/ "market") where AI agents now create most new databases.  
– Databricks also launched Agent Bricks, an AI agent platform focused on handling mundane organizational tasks rather than superintelligence.  
– Employees had two secondary share sale opportunities in 2025 but did not fully utilize them, indicating they retained significant equity.  

==D== atabricks has secured a **$1 billion funding round** at a valuation of $100 billion, according to sources familiar with the transaction. This latest investment, co-led by Thrive and Insight Partners, underscores the company’s aggressive expansion into the rapidly evolving AI infrastructure market. The influx of capital will fuel two major strategic initiatives: the development of an AI agent-focused database and an enterprise-grade AI agent platform.

Insiders reveal the round was significantly oversubscribed, though Databricks opted not to raise additional capital beyond the billion-dollar mark. The company’s strong financial position, bolstered by a previous record-breaking $10 billion raise earlier this year, meant operational funding wasn’t the primary motivator. Instead, the focus is squarely on innovation and market disruption.

This round was structured as a primary raise, meaning no employee shares were sold as part of the transaction. However, Databricks has already facilitated two secondary share sale opportunities for staff this year, allowing them to liquidate significant portions of their equity. Interestingly, employees chose to retain more shares than they sold, signaling strong internal confidence in the company’s future trajectory.

Central to Databricks’ growth strategy is **Lakebase**, an enterprise-grade database built on open-source Postgres and designed specifically for AI agents. CEO [Ali Ghodsi](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/ali-ghodsi/ "Ali Ghodsi") emphasized that the traditional database market, valued at over $100 billion, has remained largely unchanged for decades. Now, he argues, a fundamental shift is underway: **AI agents are creating the majority of new databases**, a trend he expects to reach near-total dominance within a year.

Ghodsi pointed to a critical differentiator for Lakebase: its **decoupled compute and storage architecture**. This design allows AI agents to rapidly spin up numerous databases without incurring prohibitive costs, addressing a key pain point for organizations scaling AI operations. This positions Lakebase as a direct competitor to platforms like Supabase, but with a specialized focus on AI-driven use cases.

The second major initiative is **Agent Bricks**, an AI agent platform launched earlier this year. Rather than targeting futuristic artificial general intelligence, Agent Bricks is built for practical, repetitive organizational tasks. Ghodsi believes the real opportunity lies in automating routine functions like employee onboarding or [HR](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/hr/ "All about HR (Department)") inquiries, applications that deliver immediate operational value.

He also acknowledged that the fresh capital will help Databricks compete for top AI talent, an increasingly expensive and competitive [endeavor](https://digitrendz.blog/entity/endeavor/ "Endeavor"). With this funding, the company is well-positioned to accelerate both product development and hiring, strengthening its foothold in the high-stakes AI infrastructure arena.
