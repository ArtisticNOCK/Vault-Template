The company plans to increase its reliance on external technology partners.

**ENERGYWIRE |** Tesla is disbanding its Dojo team, and its leader will leave the company, according to people familiar with the matter, upending the automaker’s effort to build an in-house supercomputer for developing driverless-vehicle technology.

Peter Bannon, who was heading up Dojo, is leaving and CEO Elon Musk has ordered the effort to be shut down, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. The team has lost about 20 workers recently to newly formed DensityAI, and remaining Dojo workers are being reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, the people said.

Tesla plans to increase its reliance on external technology partners, including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices for compute and Samsung Electronics for chip manufacturing, the people said.

Musk’s order marks a major shift for a program years in the making, with Dojo once positioned as central to Tesla’s multibillion-dollar effort to pull ahead in the artificial intelligence race. Tesla and Bannon didn’t respond to requests for comment.
